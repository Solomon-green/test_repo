#To make Git credential manager automatically authenticate when starting the Git terminal, you can follow these steps:

Open the Git terminal by searching for it in the start menu or by using the git command in a command prompt window.

Run the following command to enable the credential manager:
...$"git config --global credential.helper manager"

This will tell Git to use the credential manager for all repositories on your system.

To store your credentials, run a Git command that requires authentication, such as git push or git clone. 
The credential manager will prompt you to enter your username and password. Once you enter your credentials, the credential manager will save them and use them automatically for future Git operations.

If you want to disable the credential manager, you can run the following command:
...$"git config --global --unset credential.helper"

This will disable the credential manager and you will need to enter your credentials manually each time you run a 
Git command that requires authentication.
